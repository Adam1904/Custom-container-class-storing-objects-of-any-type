## About

The project was necessary to initially create a class, which was then modified and extended. The main class itself is the "cukiernia" class that represents the physical confectionery and its elements, such as the types of cakes sold, the working confectioners, or the street where it is located. The exercise itself was intended to introduce the object-oriented approach.
